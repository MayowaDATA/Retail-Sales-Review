## 📌 Project Background
Following an internal memo from the Head of Data & Business Intelligence, this project investigates fluctuations in revenue and product profitability. While overall sales volumes appeared stable, concerns were raised regarding hidden financial leakages, elevated Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), and limited visibility into high-value “whale” customers.

This analysis provides a data-driven assessment of profitability, customer behavior, and operational efficiency to support strategic decision-making.
